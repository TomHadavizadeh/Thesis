 The research presented in this thesis was conducted by the author in collaboration with Malcolm John and Laurence Carson. All figures in Chapters~\ref{ch:B2DsKK} and~\ref{ch:B2DsPhi} were produced by the author.  

 Further research is ongoing to search for the closely related \decay{\Bcp}{\Dsp\phiz} and \decay{\Bc}{\Dp\Kstarz} decays. 

 During the course of the DPhil the author was involved in performing studies on \decay{\Dp}{\pip\piz} decays. This includes writing dedicated High level trigger algorithms to select these processes in Run II and optimising the selection  


 The author was involved in maintaining and improving software to produce real-time measurements of the \lhc beam positions and widths as detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:Dec_real_time}.
