 I performed the research presented in this thesis as a member of the \lhcb collaboration. All figures and tables in this thesis were produced myself unless mentioned otherwise in the figure captions.  
During my time as a DPhil student I have contributed to a number of areas of research: 
 \begin{description}
 \item \textbf{Searches for \decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz} and \decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\Kp\Km} decays:} these analyses are described in this thesis. They were performed with help and advice from my supervisor, Malcolm John, and Laurence Carson. I performed all aspects of the data analysis. This research has been published in Ref.~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2017-032}.

 \item \textbf{Charm meson analyses:} I was involved in performing studies on \decay{\Dp}{\pip\piz} decays. These decays are reconstructed using \decay{\piz}{\ep\en\Pgamma} decays to allow the \Dp meson decay vertex to be reconstructed. My involvement included writing dedicated software trigger algorithms to select these processes in Run II and optimising the selection of candidates. This work is not yet published. 

 \item \textbf{Real-time beam measurements:} I was involved in maintaining and improving software to produce real-time measurements of the \lhc beam positions and widths as briefly described in Sec.~\ref{sec:Dec_real_time}. I worked with other experiments and \lhc machine experts to perform a \lhc-wide cross-calibration of the beam size measuring devices.  

  %\item \textbf{\Bcp meson analyses:} further research is ongoing to search for the \decay{\Bcp}{\Dsp\phiz} and \decay{\Bc}{\Dp\Kstarz} decays, closely related to the pure annihilation decays presented in this thesis.
