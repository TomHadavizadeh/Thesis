\subsection{Partially reconstructed backgrounds}
\label{sec:B2DsPhi_partrecocomps}

\subsubsection{Backgrounds to the normalisation channel}
{\color{Blue}
The modes $\B^+ \to \Dsp D^{*0}$ and $\B^+ \to \Dsp^{*} D^{0}$ can both contribute partially reconstructed backgrounds to the $\Bu \to \Dsp \Dzb$ normalisation mode.
Each decay requires two different shapes to model it accurately, due to the two possible decay modes of the excited $D$ meson resonance.
The $\B^+ \to \Dsp D^{*0}$ decay with $D^{*0} \to D^0 \pi^0$ (branching fraction of 62\%) is modelled with a \texttt{RooHORNSdini} shape.
The $\B^+ \to \Dsp D^{*0}$ decay with $D^{*0} \to D^0 \gamma$ (branching fraction of 38\%) is modelled with a \texttt{RooHILLdini} shape.
These two shapes are then summed together according to the ratio of $D^{*0}$ branching fractions, taking into account also the percentage of each decay that is cut away by 
the lower bound on the $\Dsp \Dzb$ mass in the fit.
The $\B^+ \to \Dsp^{*} D^{0}$ decay with $\Dsp^{*} \to \Dsp \pi^0$ (branching fraction of 6\%) is modelled with a \texttt{RooHORNSdini} shape.
The $\B^+ \to \Dsp^{*} D^{0}$ decay with $\Dsp^{*} \to \Dsp \gamma$ (branching fraction of 94\%) is modelled with a \texttt{RooHILLdini} shape.
These two shapes are then summed together in the same way as the two $\B^+ \to \Dsp D^{*0}$ shapes.
The four shapes for $\B^+ \to \Dsp D^{*0}$ and $\B^+ \to \Dsp^{*} D^{0}$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:B2DsPhi_DsD0_partreco}.
The parameters of these shapes are fixed in the fit to data, except for two. Firstly a global shift parameter (allowing for the fact that the fitted mean $B^+$ mass may differ from the nominal mass used in the simulation) is left free, but is common to all the partially reconstructed background shapes. Secondly a parameter that allows the relative heights of the two peaks in the double peaked structures to differ is left floating. This is also common to all partially reconstructed shapes. This allows for any selection dependence that might affect the two peaks differently.
The experimental resolution for these shapes is taken to be the effective resolution of the signal double Crystal Ball shape (\ie the average of the two Crystal Ball 
widths, weighted with their relative normalisation). These parameters are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:DDstar_paramters}.

$\B^+ \to \Dsp^{*} D^{*0}$


A shape has been added to the fit model to account for $\B^+ \to \Dsp^{*} D^{*0}$ events where two soft neutral particles have missed, one from each excited $D$ meson decay. In principle this shape should be created from eight individual contribution shapes as either $D$ meson can miss a $\gamma$ or $\pi^{0}$ and there are two distinguishable helicity combinations for either. We approximate this shape by a single \texttt{RooHILLdini} shape, with a similar set of parameters as listed in Table~\ref{tab:DDstar_paramters}. The kinematic endpoints are estimated by combining the effect of missing a $\pi^{0}$ and a $\gamma$, the dominant shape given the branching fractions of $D^{*0} \to D^{0} [\pi^{0}/\gamma]$ and $D_{s}^{*} \to D_{s} [\pi^{0}/\gamma]$. These endpoints and the choice of shape are varied and the effect on the measured branching fraction included as a systematic uncertainty.

\subsubsection{Backgrounds to the signal channel}
{\color{Blue}


\begin{description}
\item The $\B^+ \to \Dsp^{*} \phi$ decay contributes a partially reconstructed background to the $\Bu \to \Dsp \phi$ signal mode.
Since this decay has a vector-vector final state, the helicity state of the decay products is not fixed, and is unknown as this mode has not yet been observed.
The $\B^+ \to \Dsp^{*} \phi$ decay with $\Dsp^{*} \to \Dsp \pi^0$ and helicity configuration 010 (101) is modelled with a \texttt{RooHORNSdini} (\texttt{RooHILLdini}) shape.
The $\B^+ \to \Dsp^{*} \phi$ decay with $\Dsp^{*} \to \Dsp \gamma$ and helicity configuration 010 (101) is modelled with a \texttt{RooHILLdini} (\texttt{RooLITTLEHORNSdini}) shape.
The shapes for the different $\Dsp^{*}$ decays are summed as for the $\B^+ \to \Dsp^{*} D^{0}$ case above, while the relative weighting of each helicity configuration is taken 
to be 50\%, in the absence of knowledge of these decays. Additionally, the distribution of each shape in the helicity angle described in Section~\ref{subsec:Hel} is approximated to be $\cos^2(\theta)$ for the longitudinally polarized shapes (010) and $\sin^2(\theta)$ for the transversely (101). The fraction in each bin for 010 or 101 is taken from the appropriate integrals of these assumed distributions. 
The four shapes for $\B^+ \to \Dsp^{*} \phi$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:B2DsPhi_DsPhi_partreco}.
The parameters of these shapes are treated in exactly the same way as those for the $\B^+ \to \Dsp D^{*0}$ and $\B^+ \to \Dsp^{*} D^{0}$ shapes: the parameters are fixed in the fit to data, except for the global shift parameter and the relative double peak heights, and the experimental resolution is taken from the signal double Crystal Ball shape.

\subsection{Combinatorial  backgrounds}
\label{sec:B2DsPhi_combcomps}



\section{Fit strategy}
\label{sec:B2DsPhi_fitstrategy}

The yield of \decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz} candidates are determined using a simultaneous unbinned maximum likelihood fit in a number of different categories.
These categories are designed to help separate the different contributions such that the relative contributions can be distinguished.
The candidates are treated as quasi-two-body decays in which all signal candidates are corrected with the same efficiency. 



\subsection{Simultaneous categories}
\label{sec:B2DsPhi_fitstrategy}

{\color{Red}
\begin{itemize}
\item \Dsp decay mode categories
\item $m(\Kp\Km)$ invariant mass categories 
\item helicity angle categories 
\item MC plots of each
\end{itemize}
}
The $\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz}$ signal and normalisation channels are fitted simultaneously in separate categories, as are the three \Dsp decay modes, with the $\decay{\Dsp}{\Kp\Km\pip}$ mode split further into $\decay{\Dsp}{\phi \pip}$ and non-\phiz submodes. This exploits the high purity of the $\decay{\Dsp}{\phi \pip}$ decay.


As the $\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz}$ decay involves the decay of a pseudoscalar particle to a pseudoscalar and vector particle, the \phiz vector meson ($J^{P} = 1^{-}$) must be produced longitudinally polarised. For a longitudinally polarised \phiz meson decaying to $\Kp\Km$, the distribution of the angle $\theta_{K}$, defined as the angle that the kaon meson forms with the \B momentum in the \phiz rest frame, is proportional to $\cos^{2}{\theta_{K}}$. The distribution of $\cos{\theta_{K}}$ for $\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz}$ as determined from simulated events is shown in Fig ?.

The fit to $\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz}$ candidates finds a total yield of $N(\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz}) = 5.3 \pm 6.7$, summed across all categories and \Dsp meson decay modes. 
A yield of $N(\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\Km\Kp}) = 65 \pm 10 $ is found, consistent with the yield obtained from the full $\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\Kp\Km}$ measurement. 
The branching fraction for $ \decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz}$ decays is calculated as

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}(\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz}) = R \times \frac{\mathcal{B}(\decay{\Dzb}{\Kp\Km})}{\mathcal{B}(\decay{\phi}{\Kp\Km})} \times \mathcal{B}(\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\Dzb}),
\label{eq:branching_fraction_calc}
\end{equation}
where the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(\decay{\phi}{\Kp\Km})= 0.489 \pm 0.005$ has been used~\cite{PDG2016}. 

The free variable $R$ is defined to be the ratio of the signal and normalisation yields, corrected for the selection efficiencies.
The yield of signal candidates in each \Dsp mode is constructed from $R$ and the normalisation yield for the given \Dsp decay mode, $N(\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\Dzb})$. The product of these two quantities is corrected by the ratio of selection efficiencies

\begin{equation}
N(\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz}) = R \times N(\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\Dzb}) \times \frac{\epsilon(\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz})}{\epsilon(\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\Dzb})}.
\label{eq:branching_fraction_R}
\end{equation}

The simultaneous fit measures a single value of $R$ for all \Dsp decay mode categories. From an ensemble of pseudoexperiments, $R$ is distributed normally. It can be written as the ratio of signal and normalisation branching fractions using Eq.~{\ref{eq:branching_fraction_calc}. The value is determined to be 

\begin{equation}
R = \frac{\mathcal{B}(\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz})}{\mathcal{B}(\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\Dzb})}\times \frac{\mathcal{B}(\decay{\phi}{\Kp\Km})}{\mathcal{B}(\decay{\Dzb}{\Kp\Km})} =(1.6^{+2.2}_{-1.9}\pm 1.1) \times 10^{-3}, 
\end{equation}
where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This corresponds to a branching fraction for $\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz}$ decays of

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}(\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz}) = (1.2^{+1.6}_{-1.4} \pm 0.8  \pm 0.1)\times 10^{-7},
\label{eq:branching_fraction}
\end{equation}
where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic, and the third results from the uncertainty on the branching fractions $\mathcal{B}(\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\Dzb})$, $\mathcal{B}(\decay{\phi}{\Kp\Km})$ and $\mathcal{B}(\decay{\Dzb}{\Kp\Km})$. Considering only the statistical uncertainty, the significance of the $\decay{\Bp}{\Dsp\phiz}$ signal is 0.8 standard deviations ($\sigma$).
