    I owe a great deal of gratitude to a number of people, without whom this thesis would not have been possible.

    First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Malcolm John, for his invaluable guidance and encouragement throughout my DPhil.  

    I'm grateful to everyone in the Oxford LHCb group for their support and 
    LHCb people

    
    Oxford people. 

    The 18 months I spend at CERN were some my most enjoyable. 

    Finally, I would like to thank my parents and sister, Kate, for their love and support.
